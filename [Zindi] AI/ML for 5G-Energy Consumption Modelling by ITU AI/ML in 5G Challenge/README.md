# Objectives:
Objective A: Develop a model able to estimate the energy consumed by different base station products. The participants are required to develop a model that estimates the energy consumed by different base station products, taking into consideration the impact of various engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.

Objective B: Achieve generalization capabilities across different base station products. The model must estimate the energy consumption of a new base station product based on measurements collected from existing ones, such as Products A, B, and C. For example, if training data is available for these three products, the model must be able to provide an estimate of the energy consumed by Product D.

Objective C: Achieve generalization capabilities across different base station configurations. The model must predict the energy consumption of newly configured parameters based on a small number of real network configuration parameters. For instance, if the training data contains samples collected from many base station products, when the transmit power is set to 30, 35, and 43 dBm, the model must estimate the energy consumed when the transmit power is set to 40 dBm.
