##Overview
The first automated essay scoring competition to tackle automated grading of student-written essays was twelve years ago. How far have we come from this initial competition? With an updated dataset and light years of new ideas we hope to see if we can get to the latest in automated grading to provide a real impact to overtaxed teachers who continue to have challenges with providing timely feedback, especially in underserved communities.

The goal of this competition is to train a model to score student essays. Your efforts are needed to reduce the high expense and time required to hand grade these essays. Reliable automated techniques could allow essays to be introduced in testing, a key indicator of student learning that is currently commonly avoided due to the challenges in grading.
